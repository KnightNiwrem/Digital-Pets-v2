# Feature Flags Roadmap

The following feature flags have been removed from `src/config/gameConfig.json` as they are out of scope for the current development phase. They are reserved for potential implementation in future updates:

- `enableTrading`
- `enableMultiplePets`
- `enableAchievements`
- `enableDailyQuests`
- `enablePvP`
- `showAdvancedStats`
- `allowCheatCodes`

These flags will be reconsidered when the project reaches the appropriate phase for these features.
